# GRIP-Task-3-Unsupervised_learning
Unsupervised Learning - Which doesnot have any labels in the dataset

Here I used Iris dataset which is a inbuilt dataset in sklearn library

Iris dataset - Contains information about different types
here the task is to cluster the given inputs into those types
I used K-means clustering algorithm in unsupervised learning to solve the problem statement.
